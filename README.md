The old classic Fizzbuzz!

You probably already know how this works but if not heres a quick breakdown:

You have a method called fizzbuzz which takes in a number.

If the number is divisible 3 the method returns "fizz"

If the number is divisible 5 the method returns "buzz"

If the number is divisible 3 and 5 the method returns "fizzbuzz"

In all other cases the method returns the number passed in.

This is a test driven example using Ruby and Rspec.
